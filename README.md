Vovilo Cunha CCNA Labs — My comprehensive collection of Cisco networking lab configurations, topology designs, and troubleshooting exercises developed for my  CCNA certification training. This repository includes practical implementations of routing, switching, VLANs, subnetting, and network security concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3. 
# Vovilos CCNA Labs

A structured collection of networking labs, configurations, and topology exercises designed to support practical learning and professional development in Cisco networking technologies.

## 📘 Overview

This repository serves as my learning portfolio for my journey in networking fundamentals and Cisco technologies. It will contains a series of simulated lab environments developed using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and **GNS3**, covering key topics aligned with the **CCST (Cisco Certified Support Technician)** and **CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** certification paths.

Each lab focuses on reinforcing core networking concepts through hands-on practice, configuration, and troubleshooting scenarios.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen foundational knowledge of networking concepts, protocols, and architectures.  
- Develop my practical skills in **routing**, **switching**, **VLANs**, **subnetting**, and **network security**.  
- Gain confidence in configuring and managing Cisco devices in simulated environments.  
- Build a solid foundation for **CCST** certification and transition towards the **CCNA** level.
